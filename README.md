# Project Title

Analyzing and Exploring Patterns in American Thanksgiving Dinner Menus

# Overview

In this simple project, we focus on analyzing American Thanksgiving Dinner menus using the __Pandas__ library.

The dataset was compiled by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) and can be downloaded from here : https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015.

The dataset is in .csv format and should be present in your working directory as 'thanksgiving.csv' if you wish to run the notebook.

Suggestions for improvements will be highly appreciated!
